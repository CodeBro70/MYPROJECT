Cow’s milk has become a frankenfood. It no longer has the nutritional value or health benefits it once did. There are alternatives however.

-There are 5,416 species of mammals, all of which produce milk.

-One can also derive a milk-like substance from plants.

-Many of these alternatives have superior health benefits over cow’s milk.

In mid 1800’s, the average cow yielded just under 2 quarts of milk per day. By 1960, the yield was just over 9 quarts per day! Today, Cows yield up to 50 quarts of milk per day!

The reason for this dramatic increase in milk production is because cows were bred purely to have an unnaturally high milk production. NOT FOR THE QUALITY !!


Why are growth hormones so bad for cows and people?


This is unnatural, forced, and unhealthy for both cows and humans.

Additionally, people with dairy allergies can suffer:

-Eczema


-Asthma


-Hives


-Acne


-And other symptoms (all of these happened to my siblings)

Solution?

Alternative Milk Sources.

Calcium is also better absorbed from plant derived milk. -Grown cows don’t drink milk, they get their calcium from plants -Societies that don’t drink cow’s milk suffer less osteoporosis (weak bones)

Here are other, popular milk sources one might find in grocery stores.

  
1. Goat’s milk is less allergenic. 2. Goat’s milk is naturally homogenized. 3. Goat’s milk is easier to digest. 4. Goat’s milk rarely causes lactose intolerance. 5. Goat’s milk matches up to the human body better than cow’s milk.

-The benefits of sheep’s milk are very similar to goat’s milk. -Buffalo milk hasn’t been as manipulated as cow’s milk, so it is not subject to the same antibiotics, GMOs, and growth hormones as cows.


In a survey (conducted by Justin Genco), the 9 participants were found to actually prefer alternative milks/milk products more than cows. This shows how trying new milk sources may be of great pleasure as well as the health and nutritional benefits provided.

Summary

-Cow’s milk has been genetically modified and has become a frankenfood. -There are many other milk sources besides cow’s. -Trying new milks and milk products may result in one discovering something that is better for one’s health and that is actually more enjoyable.
