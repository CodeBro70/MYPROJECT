<h3> Cow’s milk has become a frankenfood. It no longer has the nutritional value or health benefits it once did. 

There are alternatives however. </h3>
</head>
<body>
<p> -There are 5,416 species of mammals, all of which produce milk.</p>
<p> -One can also derive a milk-like substance from plants. </p>
<p>-Many of these alternatives have superior health benefits over cow’s milk. </p>
  <p>In mid 1800’s, the average cow yielded
 just under
 2 quarts of milk
    per day. 
By 1960, 
the yield was 
just over 
  9 quarts per day! 
  Today, 
Cows yield up to 
50 quarts 
    of milk per day!</p>
  <p>The reason for this dramatic increase in milk production is because cows were bred purely to have an unnaturally high milk production.
    NOT FOR THE QUALITY !! </p>

  <h3> Why are 
growth hormones 
so bad for cows 
    and people?</h3>
<img src=
 <p>This is
 unnatural,
 forced,
  and unhealthy for both cows and humans. </p>
 <p>Additionally, people with dairy allergies can suffer:
-Eczema
-Asthma
-Hives
-Acne
-And other symptoms
(all of these happened 
   to my siblings)</p>
