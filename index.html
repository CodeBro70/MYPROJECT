<h3> Cow’s milk has become a frankenfood. It no longer has the nutritional value or health benefits it once did. 

There are alternatives however. </h3>

<body>
<p> -There are 5,416 species of mammals, all of which produce milk.</p>
<p> -One can also derive a milk-like substance from plants. </p>
<p>-Many of these alternatives have superior health benefits over cow’s milk. </p>
  <p>In mid 1800’s, the average cow yielded
 just under
 2 quarts of milk
    per day. 
By 1960, 
the yield was 
just over 
  9 quarts per day! 
  Today, 
Cows yield up to 
50 quarts 
    of milk per day!</p>
